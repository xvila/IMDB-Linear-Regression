# Predicting Box Office Gross with IMDB

As my first Linear Regression project I attempted to predict the domestic box
office gross of movies scraped from [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com). I specifically
focused on a list that contained movies that were based on books. That list can
be found
[here](http://www.imdb.com/search/keyword?keywords=based-on-novel&mode=detail&page=1&ref_=kw_nxt&sort=moviemeter,asc).
